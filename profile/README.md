# Welcome to NodeSpace Hosting!
We are a small, but growing, web hosting and IaaS provider based in Richmond, Virginia but we serve the world! We are proud supporters of open source software and this is our git mirror for most of our projects.

## Frequently Asked Questions

_**Git mirror?**_  
Yes, this is our secondary repo. We primarily work from our Gitlab instance: https://git.nodespacehosting.com. Contributions to our open source projects can be made on Github and we'll pull them into our Gitlab instance. At the same time as we contribute, we will push to Github. Some projects are exclusively on Github.

_**Some of this code can help competitors! Why are you doing this?**_  
True, but unlike some of our colleagues, we believe that competition is healthy. While we'd love to be larger than GoDaddy, we're happy we're not.

_**How do I file bugs?**_
If the project repo here has the "Issues" tab, you can file bugs right here on Github. If the "Issues" tab is missing, you will need to file the bug in our Bugzilla tracker. You can register for an account on our company's Bugzilla tracker: https://bugzilla.nodespace.com/createaccount.cgi. 

_**What kind of web hosting do you have?**_
Glad you asked! We have developer-friendly cPanel shared hosting (https://www.nodespace.com/hosting/shared-hosting/), reseller hosting if you like to manage your clients (https://www.nodespace.com/hosting/reseller-hosting/), Virtual Private Servers (https://www.nodespace.com/hosting/vps/), Dedicated Bare Metal (https://www.nodespace.com/servers/outlet/), and we specialize in Proxmox VE (https://www.nodespace.com/hosting/proxmox-hosting/). If you have questions or need something custom, please don't hesitate to contact us!
